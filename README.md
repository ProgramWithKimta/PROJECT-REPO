# Foodies Delight

## Description

As disorganized cooking enthusiasts, we want an application that stores all of our favorite recipes in one central location. Deciding what to eat everyday, remembering all the ingredients and the cooking instructions is too stressful. We wanted a simple streamlined application that houses our recipes and that we can access from the web. While working on this, we learned how to create forms, use Github, use Pure CSS framework, and a multitude of other things. 


## Location of Application

https://programwithkimta.github.io/PROJECT-REPO/

## Usage

Enter the title, ingredients, and instructions for the recipe in the respective fields in the form on the right, and click Submit. It will be added in the center of the page.

To delete all recipes, click the Delete button underneath 'Your Favorite Recipe' header.

Recipes will be stored locally and be persistent on the application page.
